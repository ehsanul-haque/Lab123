Title:

Write a Program to calculate and display the volume of a CUBE having its height (h=10cm), width
(w=12cm) and depth (8cm).

Problem:

The problem is to calculate the volume of a CUBE having its inputs parameters identified as: Height (integer type), width (integer type) and depth (integer type). The output of the program is to display the volume; hence the output parameter is identified as vol (integer type). During the processing or calculation phase, we don’t need any extra parameters (variables) for this problem.
The volume of the cube is the multiplication of its height, width and depth, hence the mathematical
formula to calculate volume is:
vol = height* width* depth. (vol = h*w*d) 

  Tasks:

1. Write a program to display “hello world”.
2. Write a program to add two numbers (5 and 7) and display its sum.
3. Write a program to multiply two numbers (10 and 8) and display its product.
4. Write a program to calculate area of a circle having its radius (r=5).
5. Write a program to calculate area of an ellipse having its axes (minor=4cm, major=6cm).
6. Write a program to calculate simple interest for a given P=4000, T=2, R=5.5. (I = P*T*R/100)

Title:

Write a program to take input of name, rollNo and marks obtained by a student in 5 subjects each have its 100 full marks and display the name, rollNo with percentage score secured.

Problem:

Based on the problem, it is required to get the input of name, roll number and marks in 5 subjects of a
student. The program should display the name; roll number and percentage of marks secured by that
student as output. The input variables shall be: name, rollNo, mSub1, mSub2, mSub3, mSub4, mSub5. We need to calculate percentage of marks obtained. So the variable ‘score’ holds the percentage to bedisplayed.
Percentage of marks obtained = total marks on 5 subjects × 100
Hence, mSum = mSub1 + mSub2 + mSub3 + mSub4 + mSub5; Score = (mSum/500) × 100 

Tasks:

1. Write a program to declare two integer and one float variables then initialize them to 10, 15, and 12.6.
Also print the variable values in the screen.
2. Write a program to prompt the user to input 3 integer values and print these values in forward and
reversed order.
3. Write a program to swap two variables values with and without using third variables
4. Write a program to check odd or even number (a) using modulus operator (b) using bitwise operator (c) without using bitwise and modulus operator (d) using conditional operator.
5. Print the value of y for given x=2 & z=4 and analyze the output.
a. y = x++ + ++x; b. y= ++x + ++x; c. y= ++x + ++x + ++x;
d. y = x>z; e. y= x>z? x:z; f. y = x&z; g. y= x>>2 +
z<<1;

Write a program to input marks of 5 subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Math, English& Biology) for a student. Display the rank of each subjects and also the result of total marks and percentage obtained with his/her rank in the class. The rank is categorized as fail (marks < 40%), pass & third division (marks between 40 to 55%), second (marks between 55 to 65%), first (marks between 65 to 80%), Distinction (marks between 80 to 95%), extra ordinary (marks above 95 to
100%). 

Tasks:
1. Write a program to find the largest and smallest among three entered numbers by the user and also
display whether the identified largest/smallest number is even or odd.
2. Write a program to check whether input alphabet is vowel or not using if-else and switch statement.
3. Write a program to check whether the entered year is leap year or not (a year is leap if it is divisible by
4 and divisible by 100 or 400.)
